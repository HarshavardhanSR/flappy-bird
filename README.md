# Flappy-bird
Flappy Bird game project built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
# About the Game
A simple side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird to fly between pipes without hitting them. Flying between each set of pipes scores 1 point and hitting them or the ground ends the game. See how long you can last and set records.
